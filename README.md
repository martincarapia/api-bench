# idrinth-api-bench

This is the central issue repository for the organisation.
We appreciate any help in finding or fixing issues, so feel free to
open any if you find oddities or errors!

If you want to contribute, have a look at the labels; they tell
both the size and difficulty of a task, as well as what repository
to change code in.

## Branch naming

We use `the-one` as our central branch since it barely won a
community vote. It was picked as a reference to the one ring -
this is the branch to rule them all.

## Privacy and Compliance

The `@idrinth-api-bench` framework and its CLI do not collect any kind of
information about its users or the APIs being tested. All data is local to
the device you run it on or the database server you configure it to dump data
in.

The diverse other tools collect the minimum of information necessary and
never share it with the outside world except as configured by you.
